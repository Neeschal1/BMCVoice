# BMCVoice
Project Overview

The BMC Feedback Management System is a full-stack application designed to facilitate efficient communication between students and the campus administration. It allows users (students or clients) to submit suggestions, complaints, or queries through a website interface, while administrators can monitor, read, and manage the feedback through a mobile application.

This system is built to streamline feedback collection and management for Butwal Multiple Campus (BMC), ensuring that user input is properly recorded, reviewed, and addressed.
